### Plant More Trees

Trees are being stripped from the earth at an alarming rate, but they can be replaced with a concerted effort on the part of people to plant more trees.
Trees contribute to clean air, provide shade to cool the temperature and add beauty to the neighborhood. In some cities, the trees that were planted more than 100 years ago have lived their full life cycle and need to be replaced. Some are also lost to drought or storm damage.
Whether it is a Boy Scout troop, religious group, senior class or other group of people who are ready to plant trees, there may be a few things they need to consider first.
Once the area for planting is selected, the group should find out who owns the property and get their permission to plant trees. There may be more than one property owner who needs to be consulted.

### Maintenance Plan

Other conditions may also apply such as the number of trees being planted. Some people may require a specific number and type of tree depending on the area such as 10 trees in a park or 50 fruit trees in a vacant lot or 100 conifers in a forest.
People planting the trees may also need to commit to a maintenance plan for one to three years after planting to make sure the saplings live.
